## Finger Twister

This is a simple game similar to body twister but using your fingers.

## Design of the App

1. The first activity is the setup to use a SurfaceView class. They are used to determine the number of touches supported by the device. I basically used this [sites](http://www.rbgrn.net/content/367-source-code-to-multitouch-visible-test) code to develop the SurfaceView class.
2. The main part of game runs in the second activity. This activity uses a custom adapter to display the GridView layout and handle touches.
3. Rest of the classes/activities are used to display results or information or for user input.

## Usage

** Import the whole project into Android Studio 2.0, then run the project
